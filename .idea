Oh, I see what you mean now! You might be thinking of Paul Krugman’s famous paper "The Theory of Interstellar Trade" from 1978. It was a real economic paper where Krugman humorously explored the economic implications of trading goods across interstellar distances, factoring in relativity and time dilation. It’s often cited as a clever, tongue-in-cheek exploration of serious economic concepts in a science fiction context.

Absolutely! In simple terms, Paul Krugman’s "Theory of Interstellar Trade" is a playful but serious exploration of what happens when you try to trade goods between planets or star systems that are so far away that relativity and the speed of light become significant factors.

The main dilemmas he pointed out were about how to handle interest rates and the timing of deliveries when there are huge time lags. For example, if it takes decades or centuries for goods to travel, how do you calculate interest or decide on the value of goods delivered so far in the future?

It’s both a fun thought experiment and a clever way to highlight how economic principles might stretch when dealing with the vastness of space.

“Now, how is the conclusion of this, like how should that be set? Because from what I know, when you're traveling in the speed of light, so your destination's time will work differently comparing to yours because you're traveling faster. So essentially, if you travel from planet A to B, then essentially the time that you spent on that ship will be longer, like relatively to the planet B's people. Is that right?”

Exactly. The paper concludes that when dealing with interstellar trade, you have to consider relativistic effects. Time dilation means that the traders traveling at near-light speeds will experience time differently than those who stay on the planets.

Krugman humorously suggests that you can set the interest rates and contracts using the "time" experienced by the traders, and then use relativity equations to adjust for the differences. It’s all about carefully accounting for these time discrepancies so that both parties get a fair deal, even if decades or centuries pass differently for each. It’s a fun way to show how complex economics can get when you factor in physics at cosmic scales!

You said:
“So how does the interest rate here mean? Say if I buy something from another planet, it takes decades, my time, decades, for those goods to be transported to my place, right? So is the money going to them so that the interest rate is the money they owe me for the loan of the goods?”

So, the idea is that interest rates help compensate for the time value of money or goods. If you're waiting decades for something to arrive, you’d want to be compensated for that waiting period. Essentially, the interest rate represents the extra cost the buyer pays to the seller to make up for the long wait.

In other words, if you buy something that takes decades to arrive, the seller might set an interest rate to account for the time they have to wait to be paid or for the value that changes over time. This ensures that both parties feel the deal is fair, considering the long transit times and different time experiences due to relativistic effects.






You said:
“So you're saying that if I'm paying for something, and that will take years to arrive, at the end of the day, I will pay more because the money has already been spent making those, and then just the shipment itself is taking too long, because those people who spent the money will actually earn more in that situation. Is that what you're saying?”

Exactly. The idea is that because the seller has to wait a long time to receive payment or see the goods delivered, they charge an interest to make up for that waiting period. So, when the goods finally arrive, you're effectively paying more than the original price to account for the time that’s passed. It’s similar to taking out a loan: the longer the wait, the more interest you pay, ensuring the seller is compensated for their patience and the delay in receiving their money or goods.

You said:
“So what if the pay is upfront?”

ChatGPT said:
If the payment is made upfront, then the seller has the money right away, and the buyer is essentially the one waiting for the goods. In that case, the seller might not need to charge interest on the goods themselves since they already have the funds in hand.

However, the buyer might still consider the time delay as a cost. They’ve spent their money but won’t receive the goods for a long time, so they might want some form of compensation or discount to make that waiting period worthwhile.

Ultimately, it’s about balancing the timing of payment and delivery so both parties feel they’re getting a fair deal, even if it takes years or decades for the trade to fully complete.

You said:
“Does the equation work both ways when everyone is talking about this? Because essentially, if I'm the buyer who pays up front, and if the transition time is super super long, literally I can pay nothing to just get together stuff. But on the other hand, if I'm a buyer who will pay when the goods arrive, there is an infinite amount of money I need to pay if the time is really really long, right?”

ChatGPT said:
That's a great observation. The paper highlights these complexities. If you pay upfront, you're taking on the risk of waiting a long time without having the goods. The seller already has the money, so they’re secure, but you might feel like you’ve lost value over time.

On the flip side, if you pay upon delivery and the delivery takes an extremely long time, the seller might expect a lot more because the value of that payment has changed over the years. That’s where interest rates come in, to balance out these differences.

In reality, the terms of interstellar trade would need to be very carefully negotiated. Both parties would have to agree on how to handle the time differences, the risk, and the compensation for waiting. It’s all about finding a fair balance so that neither party loses out too much due to the immense distances and time involved.
