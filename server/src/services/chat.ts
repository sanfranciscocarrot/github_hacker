DISTANCE AND TRAVEL TIME
â€¢ Distance: ${distance.toFixed(2)} AU (${distanceKm.toFixed(0)} million km)
â€¢ Ship velocity: ${shipSpeedRatio * 100}% of light speed (${shipSpeedKms.toFixed(0)} km/s)
â€¢ Earth observer time: ${earthTime.toFixed(1)} days
â€¢ Ship crew time: ${shipTime.toFixed(1)} days

RELATIVISTIC EFFECTS
â€¢ Time dilation factor (Î³): ${timeDilation.toFixed(4)}
â€¢ This means that for every 1 day on the ship, ${timeDilation.toFixed(2)} days pass on Earth
â€¢ This is a direct result of Einstein's special relativity: time dilation = 1/âˆš(1 - vÂ²/cÂ²)

ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS (Krugman's Theory)
â€¢ Base annual interest rate: ${(baseInterestRate * 100)}%
â€¢ Effective interest rate: ${(interestRate * 100).toFixed(4)}%
â€¢ Payment type: ${paymentType}

${paymentType === 'upfront' ? 
  `For upfront payment:
â€¢ The money could have been invested on Earth during the travel time
â€¢ The effective interest compounds over Earth time (${earthTime.toFixed(1)} days)
â€¢ This accounts for the opportunity cost of the payment` :
  `For payment on delivery:
â€¢ The seller must wait longer due to time dilation
â€¢ Interest compounds over dilated time (${(earthTime * timeDilation).toFixed(1)} days)
â€¢ This compensates for relativistic effects on payment timing`}

THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
According to Krugman's "Theory of Interstellar Trade" (1978):
1. Interest rates must be calculated in the appropriate reference frame
2. Time dilation creates unique arbitrage opportunities
3. The choice of payment timing (upfront vs. delivery) significantly affects costs
4. Relativistic effects cannot be ignored in interstellar commerce
